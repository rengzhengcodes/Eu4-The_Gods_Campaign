# Eu4-The_Gods_Campaign
This is the mod file for the first megacampaign of the "Not Normal Server," beginning in 867 and ending in 1444, taking place in 2022. 
## Players
The players in this campaign played as Britannia, Byzantium, Carpathia, and Germany (formerly the HRE).
## Rules (For this Play)
1. A timeskip occurred between ca. 1170 and 1400. The AI was made to play all player nations. This was both for speed of play reasons, and to destabilize internally unstable empires.
2. To prevent dev from snowballing, [an exponential decay equation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cpwayxhsbq) based off top player performance was used to determine how much dev we could bring with us to Ck3. 
    1. A conversion of the game using Ck3 dev and rest default converter settings was made before the timeskip (HRE was kept intact).
    2. Then, the total directly owned dev of a player was recorded.
    3. The highest player-owned dev was set as "m" in the equation linked above.
    4. Inputting player devs as the input value, this then gave out their allocated dev.
    5. This process was then repeated at the enddate of the megacampaign (Nov. 11, 1444). A Ck3 convert player may choose between the pre timeskip and post timeskip option. Entering Eu4 players take the dev of the worst Ck3 convert in the best section (i.e. the pythonic equivalent: max(min(pre_timeskip_dev), min(end_of_game_dev)))
    6. As we have newbie entering Ck3 players, they will have an advantage given, TBA.
3. We could only choose provinces we directly controlled in Ck3 if we were a Ck3 convert. Entering Eu4 players have free range of choice.
4. Ck3 convert empires were shattered. AI was not. The default dev conversion file was also not changed.
5. Carpathia was HREified by Ck3 player consensus.
